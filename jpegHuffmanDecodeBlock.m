%
% BITSTR is a cell array of arrays of chars. Each Huffman codeword is
% encoded as two elements of the cell array, one for the Huffman code and
% another one for the value. The first two elements in BITSTR correspond to
% the DC coefficient. BITSTR must correspond to an 8x8 block and finish 
% with the EOB code.
%
% BLOCK is an 8x8 array of coefficients after Huffman decoding.
%
% BLOCK = JPEGHUFFMANDECODEBLOCK(BITSTR, 'C') decodes the bit stream
% representation of chrominace symbols.
